<h2>Because of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, the WCA Board and the core organization team have decided to postpone the WCA World Championship to December 28-31, 2021. </h2><br><h2>We believe that the chances of carrying out the World Championship in July are decreasing. There is a good chance that in July at least some global restrictions caused by the pandemic will still be in force. A Championship in December 2021 means a postponement of 5 months. These months could be very crucial as far as the pandemic is concerned, and would make it much more likely that we can have a Championship in its own right.</h2>
